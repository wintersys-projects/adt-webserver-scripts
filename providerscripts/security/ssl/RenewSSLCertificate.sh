# Description: This script tests the current SSL certificate. If it is out of date
# or approaching its expiry date, a new certificate is generated and replaces it.
# This check is also done on the build client, where a copy of the SSL certificate
# but is necessary here, it is run daily from cron, in case the infrastructure is
# left running for extended periods meaning there is no new builds and therefore no
# opportunity to check for the validity of the certificate.
