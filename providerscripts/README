These are "provider" as in "service provider", specific scripts.
The goal of this infrastructure is as a kind of "bring your own architecture" type project which could in theory be easily modified
to run on any cloudhost providing VPS services. 
The APIs for each respective cloudhost provider have their quirks and so on, but these scripts are intended to provide an abstraction
layer which the rest of the infrastructure can call on in a uniform way irreseptive of the ultimate host which is providing the 
service. At the time of writing, I have written implementations for three providers, digital ocean, linode and exoscale. 
There is no reason at all why other providers can't be easily supported just by implementing these provider scripts.
I will write elsewhere about the process of how you go about adding your own provider(s) of choice to this infrastructure. It shoudn't
be difficult.
