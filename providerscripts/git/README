These are helper scripts for using a git based repository. Currently, support is there for 2 Git repository providers, Github and
Bitbucket. The main sourcecode for this project is stored in bitbucket, but you can deploy your application code to either.
To support additional repository providers, please modify this code to add support.
IMPORTANT: Whenever you deploy an application to a public repository, please make sure that you do not have any security keys in the 
sourcecode base or if, in the case of a database repository, the sql dump. The reason why is that there are people who look for 
security keys in public repository and if they find them and they are active, they can use them to access resources from you 
provider account which may result in unexpected billing. This is a common oversight. So, please, "BEFORE DEPLOYING TO A PUBLIC 
REPOSITORY, CHECK THAT YOUR Application CODE AND DATABASE DUMP ARE NOT LEAKING ANY SECURITY RELEVANT INFORMATION"
