# Description: When we use a proxy service the service might rotate IP addresses that it
# connects to our orgin server from and some applications have checks 
# to make sure that the requester ip hasn't changed. In such a case our application will
# fail (Joomla 4) is one example that has strict ip checking. So, we need to set the origin
# IP to be the real ip of our machine irrespective of which proxy ip address the request
# has been routed through. 
# You can find out more about this (because it stumped me for a couple of days) here:
