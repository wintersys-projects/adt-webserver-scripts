You might want to have it setup such as

  providerscripts/webserver/configuration/moodle/nginx/offline/alterna1tive_config1/nginx.conf
  providerscripts/webserver/configuration/moodle/nginx/offline/alterna1tive_config2/nginx.conf
  providerscripts/webserver/configuration/moodle/nginx/offline/alterna1tive_config3/nginx.conf

  /bin/cp providerscripts/webserver/configuration/moodle/nginx/offline/alterna1tive_config2/nginx.conf providerscripts/webserver/configuration/moodle/nginx/online/nginx.conf
