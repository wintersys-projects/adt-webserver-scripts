By default the scrips will look for the files

blockuseragents.rules
nginx.conf
site-available.conf
fastcgi_port.conf
fastcgi_socket.conf

in this directory. You can drop in replace any of these files by moving them from this directory and replacing them with configurations that you keep in the offline directory.
This is the neatest way I could think of for easily allowing you to play around and swap in and swap out your webserver configurations. I am not in any way a webserver config expert and the default files I have provided can certainly be omproved on and if you wanted to do that, very good
