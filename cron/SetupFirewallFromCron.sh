# Description: I agressively setup the firewall once the initial build is completed. This is called repeatedly
# but basically does nothing unless it is found that the firewall is inactive by the monitoring script
# which should only be possible if you have had a breach of some sort and something has disabled it.
# If there was to be some sort of "stall" then the locks are removed after 20 minutes to make sure we can always proceed
